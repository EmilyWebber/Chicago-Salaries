# Chicago-Salaries
Goal: Acquire and Cluster Chicago Public Salaries

This is a short project to drill querying APIs for public data and running results through an unsupervised clustering.

Initial hypothesis: strongest indicator of high public income is field of profession, more so than length of employment or education. I believe that police officers are the best paid employees in Chicago.

Now let's see if that's true.
